A Little personal note!
 I just wanted to say thank you, to all of you, every single person who comments, views, downloads
or gives me feedback on my models. This community is one of the best i've ever been in with the way 
you guys give feedback, and its not just hey can you release this unlocked or are you going to do 
this model. You guys motivate me to do better, convert more cars, make even more unique models, and 
try and provide you all with the highest quality models possible. 

 I read every single comment, good and bad, every review, and every single message you guys send me. 
I take all the advice you guys give, all of the criticism and all of the help you guys give me and 
try and improve my models to the best of my abilities.

 I can't say how greatful I am for every single person who supports me, and every person who has helped 
me along the way. After i do a release with my tahoe and caprice in a pack, im planning on setting up
a poll with a bunch of my cars, and letting you guys decide what my next release will be. 

 Once again, thank you to every single one of you, and if you didnt read this, well you should. Now enough
of my blabbering, to the model itself.

INSTILLATION 
=================================
To install the vehicle, navigate to the latest patch day you have in your Mods folder, for me its patchday9
and drag whatever files you want in.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\patchday9ng\dlc.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\vehicles.rpf\

To install the vehicles meta file, navigate to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Mods\update\update.rpf\common\data\levels\gta5
And drag it in there.

TO INSTALL THE EXTRA SKINS:
Take a skin of your choice, and either take it and replace the F350_sign_1 OR take the skin and rename it to F350_sign_#
(replace # with whatever number you need)

COMMON QUESTIONS
=================================
Q: Why aren't my lights bright?
A: You do not have light-enhancing mods installed. Download RadianceV and/or other mods that increase emergency lighting brightness.

Q: Will you please help me ins--
A: Did you read the readme? No? Sorry, can't help you. Yes? Then ask here.

Q: Can I put a new skin on this vehicle?
A: Be my guest, hell even go edit my skins as you please, but give proper credits!

Q: I dont have Patchday9?
A: Then put the car in your latest pactch day, or copy patchday9 over.
 
Q: Why does my game crash after I install the meta?
A: I don't know, it works in my game.

Q: Why is the truck flipping when I turn?
A: There is a vehicles meta for a reason.

Q: Why doesnt the lights look good from a distance/Why doesnt it have enviromnental lighting?
A: Becuse of the way I made the lighting setup, it was not possible to make either of these happen.

Q: When is your CHP megapack coming out?
A: Maybe next week as I start a new job a day after this truck is released, that comes before modding for free.

MODEL NOTES
=================================
- THERE IS A BUG WITH THE MODEL WHERE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CHANGE THE SKIN WITH IT, IF ANYONE CAN FIGURE IT OUT
WITH THE VEHICLE META OR KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT ON THE MODEL, PLEASE TELL ME

- This car features about 11 Extras, all sirens being used and Two different setups for rims.

- Extra list:
Extra 1 - Rambar
Extra 2 - Rambar Lights (Soundoff Ultralite, Whelen Ion Duo)
Extra 3 - Whelen Liberty II
Extra 4 - Interior lighting (Whelen Inner edge, Whelen Talon)
Extra 5 - Toolbox with Whelen Ions
Extra 7 - Bed Cap
Extra 8 - Whelen M4s
Extra 11 - ALPRS
Extra 12 - Step Boards

- There are Two versions of this truck, one with Rockstar Xds, one with the original SSV rims

- As the extra list implies, there is A LOT of stuff on this truck. Going with this, the file size suffers
quite a bit as it is around 7.3 mb for the _hi and 7 for the rest of the LODS. If you cant use this truck,
I apologize.

- I did go all out with this truck, it orginally started out as just a slicktop with a bedcap but I decided
to go all out.

- This truck is very much a multi-purpose truck. As so i've included multiple skins, SRU, CVE, Supervisor, Stealth, 
Unmarked and basic patrol skins.

- There are a few issues with the skins, but I don't much care about them as most of the time, people replace the skins 
on  my vehicles.

- You can have a very very varying setup on this truck, from being stealthy, to being completely balls to the wall.

- This was a very very fun project to make, and I'm grateful for everyone helped out.

- As with all my models, if you find any bugs with it, please let me know!
